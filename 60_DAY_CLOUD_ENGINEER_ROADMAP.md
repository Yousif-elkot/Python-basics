# üöÄ The 60-Day Cloud Engineer Roadmap (Canonical Edition)

**Mission:** To build the specific, in-demand skills of a Junior Cloud Field Engineer by mastering Linux, DevOps Python, and Cloud Native technologies.

**Your Guiding Principle:** The V.P.C.R. (Visualize, Pseudocode, Code, Refine) method is mandatory for every script, project, and challenge.

**Status:** Week 1 Complete. You are ready for the deep dive.

---

## üéØ Core Principles

This plan is built on three pillars, designed to directly map to the skills required by top-tier cloud engineering roles.

1. **üêß Linux & Networking Mastery (The Foundation):** The operating system is not just a tool; it's the environment. We will master it.

2. **üêç DevOps Python (The Tool):** We focus on Python as a tool for automation, infrastructure management, and building robust cloud services.

3. **‚ò∏Ô∏è Cloud Native & Virtualization (The Environment):** We will master the modern stack for deploying applications: Containers (Docker) and Orchestration (Kubernetes).

## üóìÔ∏è The 60-Day Detailed Plan

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Days 1-21)

#### ‚úÖ Week 1: Python Foundations & V.P.C.R. Mastery (Days 1-7) - COMPLETE

You have successfully completed this phase, mastering core data structures and, most importantly, developing a repeatable process for solving complex problems.

---

#### üî• Week 2: Linux Systems & Networking Deep Dive (Days 8-14)

**Goal:** Move from being a Linux user to a Linux engineer. Understand the "why" behind the commands and learn to manage systems professionally. Given your Arch Linux background, this week is designed to solidify your foundational knowledge.

| Day | Topic (3-4h) | Project / Key Skill |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| **8** | **The Shell & Advanced Scripting:** Shell configuration (`.bashrc`), environment variables (`$PATH`), advanced Bash scripting (functions, arguments, error handling). | **Professional Backup Script:** Upgrade a simple script into a reusable tool with functions, command-line arguments, and error checks. |

| **10** | **Process Management & systemd:** Process states, signals (SIGTERM vs SIGKILL), job control (`fg`, `bg`), and writing your own systemd service files. | **Systemd Service Management:** Take a simple Python web server (e.g., using Flask) and write a systemd service file to manage it. |
| **11** | **Networking Deep Dive:** The TCP/IP model, `ip` command (`ip addr`, `ip route`), DNS resolution (`dig`, `/etc/resolv.conf`), and firewalling with iptables concepts. | **Network Diagnostics Toolkit:** A script that automates troubleshooting by checking IP configuration, pinging a gateway, and testing DNS resolution. |
| **12** | **The Kernel & Compilation:** What is a kernel? Kernel modules (`lsmod`, `modprobe`), and the process of compiling software from source (`make`, `gcc`). | **Compile From Source:** Download the source code for a command-line tool (e.g., `htop`), compile it, and install it yourself. |
| **13** | **Practical System Hardening:** Core security skills. SSH hardening (`sshd_config`), user access control, and automated security with `fail2ban`. | **Server Hardening Script:** A Bash script that automates securing a fresh Ubuntu server (disabling root login, setting up firewall rules). |

#### üèÜ Week 8: The Capstone Project (Days 50-60)

**Goal:** Combine all your skills into a single, impressive project that directly reflects the target job description.

##### Project: The "Mini-Cloud" Operator

- **The Application:** A Python application, written using the OOP principles from Week 5.

- **Packaging:** Containerized with Docker, following the patterns from Week 4.

- **Deployment:** Deployed on your local Kubernetes cluster, using the YAML skills from Week 6.

- **The "Operator" Logic:** The Python app's job is to be a cloud operator. It will use the boto3 skills from Week 7 to:
  - **Monitor:** Periodically check the health of an AWS service (e.g., an EC2 instance).
  - **Report:** Log the status to a file and to the container's standard output.
  - **Heal:** If the service is down (e.g., an EC2 instance is stopped), the operator will automatically try to restart it.
  - **Configure:** The operator's behavior (which instance to check, etc.) will be managed by a K8s ConfigMap.

This single project demonstrates proficiency in Python, OOP, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS automation‚Äîchecking every major technical box in the job description. The final days (57-60) should be spent writing a high-quality `README.md` for this project on your GitHub, complete with architecture diagrams and setup instructions.

## ‚úÖ How This Maps to Your Target Job

| Job Requirement | How This Plan Addresses It |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Linux and networking | Week 2 is a deep dive. Weeks 3 & 4 build on it. |
| Intermediate to Advanced Python | The entire 60-day plan, culminating in the Capstone Project and OOP mastery. |
| Kubernetes, OpenStack, AWS, GCP, Azure | Week 4, 6, 7, 8. We focus on K8s (deeply), OpenStack (conceptually), and AWS (practically with boto3). |
| Develop Kubernetes operators | Week 6 & Capstone. You will learn the pattern and build a simple one. |
| Linux open source infrastructure-as-code | Week 7 & Capstone. You will write Python code that defines and manages infrastructure (boto3). |
| University degree in CS | You're already doing this! The parallel Java track in Week 5 directly supports it. |
| Drive for continual learning | Completing this demanding 60-day plan is the ultimate proof. |

## üéØ The V.P.C.R. Method (Your Core Process)

For every script, project, and challenge:

1. **Visualize:** Draw or write out what the solution looks like. What are the inputs? What are the outputs? What are the steps in between?

2. **Pseudocode:** Write the logic in plain English (or your native language) before writing any actual code. This is where you plan.

3. **Code:** Translate your pseudocode into actual Python, Bash, or YAML. Keep it clean and readable.

4. **Refine:** Test your code. Does it work? Does it handle edge cases? Is it efficient? Can someone else read it? Refactor as needed.

**This process is non-negotiable.** It is the difference between someone who copies code and someone who engineers solutions.
