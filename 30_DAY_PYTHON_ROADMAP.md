## 🎓 Java OOP Integration Strategy

### Your College OOP Course (Java)

**What you'll learn in college:**
- Classes, Objects, Constructors
- Encapsulation (private/public/protected)
- Inheritance (extends)
- Polymorphism (method overriding)
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Static vs instance members
- Exception handling (try/catch)

### How We'll Integrate It

**Days 15-17: Parallel Learning**

Each day:
1. **Morning:** Attend college Java OOP lecture (2h)
2. **Afternoon:** Translate concepts to Python (2h)
3. **Build:** Create same project in both languages (comparison learning)

**Example Day 15 Schedule:**
```
09:00-11:00  College: Java Classes & Objects
11:00-11:30  Break + lunch
11:30-12:30  Read Java code from class
12:30-14:30  Implement same in Python
14:30-15:00  Document differences (Java vs Python OOP)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Deeper OOP understanding (see two implementations)
- ✅ Learn Java (required for college)
- ✅ Master Python OOP (needed for projects)
- ✅ Save time (one concept, two languages)
- ✅ Better for interviews (know multiple languages)

**Example Projects for Both Languages:**

| Concept | Java Project | Python Project |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Classes | `BankAccount.java` | `bank_account.py` |
| Inheritance | `Animal→Dog→Cat.java` | `animal.py` |
| Interfaces | `Drawable interface` | `ABC + @abstractmethod` |
| Polymorphism | `Shape→Circle→Rectangle` | `shape.py` |

## 📈 Time Commitment

### Realistic Daily Schedule

**Weekdays (Mon-Fri):**
- **Morning (2h):** College/Work/Life
- **Afternoon (1.5h):** Python coding session 1
- **Evening (1.5h):** Python coding session 2
- **Total:** 3 hours/day minimum

**Weekends (Sat-Sun):**
- **Flexible:** 4-5 hours/day
- More project time, catching up, or resting

**Weekly Total:** 23-25 hours (very achievable)

### Flexibility Built-In

**If you're ahead of schedule:**
- Add optional projects (marked with ⭐)
- Explore advanced topics
- Contribute to open source
- Build portfolio projects

**If you're behind schedule:**
- Skip optional projects
- Combine similar days (e.g., Days 11+12 in one day)
- Focus on core concepts only
- Use weekends to catch up

**Pace Adjustment Rules:**
- ✅ Minimum: Complete Week 1-2 (data structures) - Non-negotiable
- ✅ Core: Complete Days 15-17 (OOP) + Days 22-24 (DB/Testing) - High priority
- ⚠️ Flexible: Days 8-14 can be condensed if needed
- ⚠️ Optional: Advanced async, some algorithm days can be skipped

## 🎓 Java OOP → Python OOP Translation Guide

### Key Differences to Learn

| Concept | Java | Python |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Access Modifiers** | `private`, `public`, `protected` | `_private`, `__very_private` (convention) |
| **Typing** | Static (must declare types) | Dynamic (duck typing) |
| **Interfaces** | `interface` keyword | `ABC` + `@abstractmethod` |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | No (interfaces only) | Yes (with MRO) |
| **Constructors** | `ClassName()` | `__init__(self)` |
| **Method Overloading** | Yes (different signatures) | No (use default args) |
| **Properties** | Getters/Setters | `@property` decorator |
| **Static Methods** | `static` keyword | `@staticmethod` |
| **Class Variables** | `static` fields | Class-level attributes |

### Example: Same Class in Both Languages

**Java:**
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private String owner;
    private double balance;
    
    public BankAccount(String owner, double initialBalance) {
        this.owner = owner;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

**Python:**
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner: str, initial_balance: float):
        self._owner = owner
        self._balance = initial_balance
    
    def deposit(self, amount: float) -> None:
        if amount > 0:
            self._balance += amount
    
    @property
    def balance(self) -> float:
        return self._balance
```

**Your Task:** Build both, understand differences, document insights
