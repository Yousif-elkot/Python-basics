## üß© Adaptive Learning Notes

You started with Python + Arch Linux. That‚Äôs great‚Äîlean into it:

- Use Arch as your playground (systemctl, journalctl, user/groups, permissions)
- Gradually script repetitive tasks (log cleanup, backups, service checks)
- Add networking labs using `ping`, `dig`, `traceroute`, `ip`, `ss`, `nc`
- Layer Docker once comfortable with process + resource basics

## üöÄ Hiring Readiness Criteria

| Area          | Ready When...                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Git           | Feature branches + clean history            |
| Python        | Can write tested automation scripts quickly |
| Infra         | Can provision reproducible env (Terraform)  |
| Docker        | Build secure, minimal images                |
| Debugging     | Systematic approach w/ logs & tools         |
| Communication | Each repo has clear README + rationale      |

---

## üß≠ Execution Rules

1. Ship something every day (no zero days)
2. Logs > memory ‚Äî write what you learn
3. Refactor only after working version
4. Prefer official docs before random blogs
5. Build portfolio artifacts intentionally
6. Automate what you repeat 3+ times
7. Always leave a NEXT ACTION before stopping

---

## üîÑ Iteration Strategy

When stuck:

1. Reduce scope (what‚Äôs the smallest working slice?)
2. Add logging / print introspection
3. Re-read error messages carefully
4. Test assumption in isolation (REPL / small script)
5. Move: walk, hydrate, return

---

## üèÅ Current Focus

Finish strengthening Python + CLI patterns while lightly layering Linux + basic networking commands. Docker begins once 5+ CLI tools are solid.

Stay consistent. Momentum compounds. üí™
