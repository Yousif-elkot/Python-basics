## 🎯 Day 4 Focus: Trees, Recursion & File Systems

### What You'll Learn:
- ✅ Tree data structures (Binary Trees, BST)
- ✅ Recursion (base case, recursive case, patterns)
- ✅ Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order)
- ✅ File system operations (recursive directory scanning)
- ✅ Real-world applications (file explorer, duplicate finder)

---

## 📋 Four Projects Planned

### **Project 1: Binary Search Tree** (75 min) - FOUNDATION
Build a complete BST from scratch with:
- Insert, search, delete operations
- All 4 traversal algorithms
- Helper methods (height, count, min/max, is_balanced)
- Tree visualization

**Why it matters:** Trees are fundamental to everything - file systems, databases, compilers, AI decision trees, AWS resource hierarchies

---

### **Project 2: Directory Tree Explorer** (90 min) - REAL-WORLD
Build a `tree` command clone with:
- Visual directory tree display
- Statistics (file count, total size, file types)
- Search functionality
- Depth limiting
- Professional CLI

**Commands:**
```bash
python dir_explorer.py show /path --depth 3
python dir_explorer.py stats /path
python dir_explorer.py search /path --pattern "*.py"
```

**Why it matters:** Direct application to AWS S3 bucket navigation, deployment artifact management, Docker layer analysis

---

### **Project 3: Expression Evaluator** (75 min) - ALGORITHM
Parse and evaluate math expressions using trees:
- Parse infix notation (3 + 4 * 2)
- Build expression tree
- Evaluate recursively
- Handle operator precedence
- Convert between notations (infix/prefix/postfix)

**Why it matters:** Understanding IAM policy evaluation, CloudFormation template processing, configuration parsing

---

### **Project 4: Duplicate File Finder** (60 min) - PRACTICAL
Find duplicate files to save disk space:
- Recursive file scanning
- MD5/SHA256 hashing
- Group duplicates by hash
- Show space savings
- Interactive deletion mode

**Commands:**
```bash
python duplicate_finder.py scan /path
python duplicate_finder.py scan /path --min-size 1MB
python duplicate_finder.py scan /path --delete  # Interactive
```

**Why it matters:** Docker image optimization, artifact deduplication, backup efficiency, Lambda layer management

---

## 🕐 Suggested Schedule (6-8 hours)

### Morning Session (3-4 hours):
1. **Warm-up** (30 min): Run `python learn_recursion.py` and review lessons
2. **Project 1** (2.5 hours): Implement Binary Search Tree
3. **Break** (30 min): Document and test

### Afternoon Session (3-4 hours):
1. **Project 2** (2.5 hours): Build Directory Tree Explorer  
2. **Break** (30 min): Test with real directories
3. **Choose One** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Option A: Expression Evaluator (algorithm practice)
   - Option B: Duplicate Finder (practical utility)
4. **Wrap-up** (30 min): Document, test, commit

---

## 🚀 How to Start

### Option 1: Begin with Learning (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/kot/projects/git/day4
python learn_recursion.py
```
Read the output, understand the concepts, then start Project 1.

### Option 2: Dive Right In
Read `ROADMAP.md` for Project 1 step-by-step guide and start coding!

### Option 3: Review First
1. Read `README.md` - Understand the big picture
2. Skim `ROADMAP.md` - See implementation approach
3. Run `learn_recursion.py` - Practice recursion
4. Start Project 1 with confidence!

## 💡 Key Concepts to Master Today

### Tree Terminology:
- **Root**: Top node
- **Leaf**: Node with no children
- **Height**: Longest path from root to leaf
- **Depth**: Distance from root
- **Balanced**: Left and right subtrees differ by ≤1 in height

### BST Property:
```
For every node:
  All left subtree values < node value
  All right subtree values > node value
```

### Recursion Pattern:
```python
def recursive_function(input):
    # BASE CASE: Stop condition
    if stopping_condition:
        return simple_answer
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: Break into smaller pieces
    result = combine(
        recursive_function(smaller_input_1),
        recursive_function(smaller_input_2)
    )
    return result
```

### Tree Traversal Orders:
- **Inorder** (Left → Root → Right): Sorted values from BST
- **Preorder** (Root → Left → Right): Copy tree structure
- **Postorder** (Left → Right → Root): Delete tree safely
- **Level-order** (Breadth-first): Process level by level

## 💪 Why Trees Matter

Trees power:
- **File Systems** - Every directory structure
- **Databases** - B-trees, B+ trees for indexing
- **Compilers** - Syntax trees, ASTs
- **AI/ML** - Decision trees, random forests
- **Graphics** - Scene graphs, spatial partitioning
- **Networking** - Routing tables, DNS hierarchy
- **AWS** - S3 organization, IAM policies, CloudFormation

**Master trees today = Unlock dozens of advanced concepts!** 🌳

## 🌟 Motivation

You've already completed:
- ✅ Day 1: Functions, CLI, Security (3 projects)
- ✅ Day 2: Arrays, Lists, Search (1 project)
