## üîê **Password Generator CLI Application (Day 1 - Project 3)**

### üéØ **Objective**

Build a **secure command-line password generator** with customizable options.  
This project introduces:

- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Advanced command-line interfaces with `argparse`
- Security-focused programming practices
- Character set manipulation and validation
- Professional CLI tool development

---

### ‚úÖ **Version 1 (Complete Implementation)**

#### **Core Features:**
- **Customizable Length**: Generate passwords from 4 to 128+ characters
- **Character Set Control**: Enable/disable lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols
- **Security Options**: 
  - Exclude ambiguous characters (`Il1O0`) for better readability
  - Ensure variety (at least one character from each enabled type)
- **Batch Generation**: Create multiple passwords at once
- **Professional CLI**: Full argument parsing with help text and validation
- **Password Strength**: Real-time strength assessment display

#### **Command-Line Interface:**
```bash
# Basic usage
python Password_gen.py                          # 12-char password, all types

# Custom length and count
python Password_gen.py -l 16 -c 5              # 5 passwords, 16 chars each

# Character type exclusions
python Password_gen.py --no-symbols            # No special characters
python Password_gen.py --no-uppercase          # No capital letters
python Password_gen.py --no-digits             # No numbers

# Security options
python Password_gen.py --no-ambiguous          # Exclude Il1O0
python Password_gen.py --no-variety            # Allow passwords without variety

# Combinations
python Password_gen.py -l 20 --no-symbols --no-ambiguous -c 3
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```
Generated 3 password(s) with length 20:
Character types: Lowercase Uppercase Digits
(Ambiguous characters excluded)
Password strength: Very Strong
