## üìù Daily Learning Log

### Day 5 - October 4, 2025
**Topic:** Hash Tables & Dictionaries  
**Time:** 4 hours  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What I Built:**
- Custom Hash Table from scratch (~200 LOC)
  - Hash function using ASCII sum % size
  - Collision handling with chaining
  - Auto-resize at load factor > 0.7
  - All CRUD operations (insert, search, delete)
- Word Frequency Analyzer CLI tool (~150 LOC)
  - Text tokenization with regex
  - Stop word filtering
  - JSON/CSV export
  - Top N word analysis

**What I Learned:**
- Hash function design (converting keys to indices)
- Collision handling strategies (chaining vs open addressing)
- Load factor and dynamic resizing
- Python's Counter and defaultdict
- Regular expressions for text parsing
- CSV module for data export
- CLI argument parsing

**Challenges:**
- Fixed syntax error in delete() method (missing comma)
- Fixed logic error in insert() method (backwards conditional)
- Understanding when to trigger resize

**Key Insight:**
Hash tables give O(1) lookup by trading space for speed. The hash function is critical - a bad one creates too many collisions!

**Stats:**
- Lines coded: ~350 (all by me!)
- Tests passed: 10/10
- Bugs debugged: 2

**Tomorrow:**
Graphs Part 1 - BFS and DFS! üöÄ

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What I Built:**
- Binary Search Tree with full operations (insert, search, delete, traversals)
- Directory Tree Explorer CLI tool (recursive scanning, ASCII visualization)
- Production-ready code with comprehensive documentation

**What I Learned:**
- Recursion patterns (base case + recursive case)
- Tree traversal algorithms (DFS and BFS)
- File system operations with os module
- ASCII art generation
- Production code cleanup (removed TODOs, enhanced docstrings)

**Challenges:**
- Understanding tree delete operation (3 cases)
- Managing recursion depth in directory scanning
- Getting ASCII visualization characters right

**Key Insight:**
Recursion became much easier after BST practice. Directory scanning felt natural!
