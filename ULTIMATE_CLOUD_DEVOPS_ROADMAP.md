- ‚ùå **Perfectionism** - Ship projects even if not perfect
- ‚ùå **Isolation** - Not joining communities, asking questions
- ‚ùå **Skipping fundamentals** - Linux, networking, scripting are essential!
- ‚ùå **No documentation** - Projects without READMEs are useless
- ‚ùå **Analysis paralysis** - "Which cloud? Which tool?" Just pick one and start!

### **Certification Mistakes:**

## üéØ YOUR CURRENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS

### **Where You Are Now:**
- ‚úÖ Month 1, Week 1: Day 5/7 (71% of Week 1 complete!)
- ‚úÖ 4 days completed (13 projects, 3800+ LOC)
- ‚úÖ Strong momentum üî•
- üìç **Current task:** Finish Day 5 (Hash Tables)

### **Next 48 Hours:**
1. **TODAY (Day 5):** 
   - ‚úÖ Run interactive tutorial (30-45 min)
   - ‚úÖ Build custom Hash Table (60-90 min)
   - ‚úÖ Build Word Frequency Analyzer (60-90 min)
   - ‚úÖ Test, document, commit

2. **TOMORROW (Day 6):**
   - ‚úÖ Start Graphs Part 1

3. **DAY AFTER (Day 7):**
   - ‚úÖ Graphs Part 2 - Network Topology Analyzer
   - ‚úÖ **WEEK 1 COMPLETE!** üéâ

### **This Weekend Decision:**
After completing Week 1 (Days 1-7), you need to decide:

**Option A:** Keep current Python plan (algorithm-focused)  
**Option B:** Switch to DevOps-aligned plan (Bash + system integration) ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**  
**Option C:** Hybrid approach

**My Strong Recommendation:** Option B (DevOps-aligned)

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Bash scripting is **non-negotiable** for DevOps
- ‚úÖ System integration (Python + Bash + Linux) is what you'll do daily
- ‚úÖ DevOps-focused projects are more impressive for your target role
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition to Month 2 (Linux Administration)
- ‚úÖ Directly aligned with both roadmaps you shared
