# My Journey to Becoming a Cloud & DevOps Engineer

This repository is the central hub for my self-directed learning plan to become a professional Cloud and DevOps Engineer. It serves as a living document where I track my daily progress, projects, and notes on the essential technologies and concepts in the field.

## üéØ Current Focus

My immediate goals are to build a strong foundation in three key areas:

1.  **Core Programming:** Using Python for automation/scripting and Java to master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
2.  **Algorithmic Problem-Solving:** Sharpening my analytical and coding skills through competitive programming (ICPC).
3.  **Operating Systems:** Deepening my knowledge of Linux as a primary environment for cloud infrastructure.
