## 🎯 Core Requirements (Must Complete)

**Non-Negotiable:**
- ✅ Days 1-5: Data structures (foundational)
- 📋 Days 6-7: Graphs (interview critical)
- 📋 Days 15-17: OOP (Java + Python)
- 📋 Days 19-20: APIs (DevOps essential)
- 📋 Days 22-23: Databases (DevOps essential)
- 📋 Day 24: Testing (professional skill)
- 📋 Days 29-30: Capstone (portfolio)

**That's 16 core days.** Rest is flexible!

---

## 🔄 Java OOP Integration (Days 15-17)

### The Smart Strategy

**Morning (2h):** College Java OOP lecture  
**Afternoon (2h):** Implement same concepts in Python  
**Result:** Master OOP in 2 languages simultaneously!

### What You'll Learn Both In
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes & Interfaces
- Encapsulation
- Static vs Instance members

### Why This Works
- ✅ Deeper understanding (2 implementations)
- ✅ Java required for college
- ✅ Python needed for projects
- ✅ Interview advantage (bilingual)
- ✅ Time saved (one concept, two languages)

---

## ⚡ Daily Schedule Template

### Weekdays (3-4 hours)
```
Afternoon Session (1.5-2h):
├── Review yesterday's work (10 min)
├── Read today's guide (20 min)
└── Code session 1 (60-90 min)

Evening Session (1.5-2h):
├── Code session 2 (60-90 min)
├── Test & debug (20 min)
└── Git commit + update tracker (10 min)
```

### Weekends (4-5 hours)
```
Flexible longer sessions or catch-up time
```

**Weekly Total:** 23-25 hours (very achievable)
